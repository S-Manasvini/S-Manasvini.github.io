Our story begins in the 4th century, a tale as old as many branches of mathematics.
<br>
A  geometer Pappus suspected that 
the elegant shape of the honeycomb resulted not from the bee's innate sense of geometric beauty but from nature's efficiency.
Since life forms rely on a delicate balance of cost and efficiency, he guessed this used the least amount of wax to build cells.

This hypothesis led to the Honeycomb Conjecture, inspired by his essay on "the sagacity of bees."
