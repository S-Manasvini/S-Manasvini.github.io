Our story begins in the 4th century, a tale as old as many branches of mathematics.
<br>
A  geometer Pappus suspected that 
the elegant shape of the honeycomb resulted not from the bee's innate sense of geometric beauty but from nature's efficiency.
Since life forms rely on a delicate balance of cost and efficiency, he guessed this used the least amount of wax to build cells.

This hypothesis led to the Honeycomb Conjecture, inspired by his essay on "the sagacity of bees."

"""but, first collecting the sweets of the most beautiful flowers which grow on the earth, they make from them, 
for the reception of the honey, the vessels which we call honeycombs, (with cells) all equal, similar and contiguous to one another, 
and hexagonal in form. And that they have contrived this by virtue of a certain geometrical forethought we may infer in this way.
They would necessarily think that the figures must be such as to be contiguous to one another, that is to say. to have their sides common,
 in order that no foreign matter could enter the interstices between them and so defile the purity of their produce. Now only three rectilinear 
figures would satisfy the condition, I mean regular figures which are equilateral and equiangular; for the bees would have none of the figures which are not uniform .... 
There being then three figures capable by themselves of exactly filling up the space about the same point, the bees by reason of their instinctive wisdom chose for 
the construction of the honeycomb the figure which has the most angles, because they conceived that it would contain more honey than either of the two others.
Bees, then, know just this fact which is of service to themselves, that the hexagon is greater than the square and the triangle and will hold more honey for the 
same expenditure of material used in constructing the different figures. We, however, claiming as we do a greater share in wisdom than bees, will investigate a problem of 
still wider extent, namely, that, of all equilateral and equiangular plane figures having an equal perimeter, that which has the greater number of angles is always greater,
and the greatest plane figure of all those which have a perimeter equal to that of the polygons is the circle."""</font>
