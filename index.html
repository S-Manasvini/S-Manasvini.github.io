"God has given the best and most perfect notion of wisdom in general and of mathematical science in particular, 
but a partial share in these things he allotted to some of the unreasoning animals as well.
<br>
There being then three figures capable by themselves of exactly filling up the space about the same point, 
the bees by reason of their instinctive wisdom chose for the construction of the honeycomb the figure which 
has the most angles, because they conceived that it would contain more honey than either of the two others."
