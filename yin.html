Life isn't yin and yang. There are so many shades between right and wrong. Black and white. 
The process of transformations is where we rediscovered ourselves. Let us live through white 
,black and all shades of grey</left>
<br>
<br>
Yin and yang elements come in pairs—such as the moon and the sun, female and male, dark and bright, 
cold and hot, passive and active, and so on—but note that yin and yang are not static or mutually 
exclusive terms. While the world is composed of many different, sometimes opposing, forces, 
these can coexist and even complement each other. Sometimes, forces opposite in nature even rely 
on one another to exist. The nature of yin-yang lies in the interchange and interplay of the two 
components. The alternation of day and night is just such an example: there cannot be a shadow without light. 

The balance of yin and yang is important. If yin is stronger, yang will be weaker, and vice versa.
 Yin and yang can interchange under certain conditions so that they are usually not yin and yang 
alone. In other words, yin elements can contain certain parts of yang, and yang can have some
 components of yin. This balance of yin and yang is perceived to exist in everything.
<br>
<br>
<b>What about the symbol</b>
<br>
The yin-yang symbol consists of a circle divided into two halves by a curved line. 
One half of the circle is black, typically representing the yin side; the other is white, for the yang side. A dot of 
each color is situated near the center of the other's half. The two halves are thus intertwining across a spiral-like 
curve that splits the whole into semicircles, and the small dots represent the idea that both sides carry the seed of the other. 
<br>
The white dot in the black area and the black dot in the white area connote coexistence and unity of opposites to form a
 whole. The curvy line signifies that there are no absolute separations between the two opposites. The yin-yang symbol,
 then, embodies both sides: duality, paradox, unity in diversity, change, and harmony.
