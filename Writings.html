Hey stranger:) Looks like all the chaos in your life has brought you here finally. Let me be your guide, and you will feel my presence
 throughout. We shall sail through dangerous seas and desolate islands; sometimes, we will have to cross deserts, but the oasis shall quench
 both our thirsts. We might get lost among mirages or kidnapped by bandits, but that is just the little girl who is lost in the
labyrinth of my memories acting up,she shall
sleep soon, and we will continue our crusade. Through my words and a few famous sonnets, we shall embark 
on a cruise into the void where everything forgotten and broken finds solace. Let us begin...

The monotonous cover of blue sky, dull and sober aided by my melancholy presses against the landscape imparting the hue of sorrow everywhere while the land and sea charge against each other like life and death.

I am waging a war here. Hopelessly keeping lovers away and turning them against each other. I am irrevocably in love with life. Prudently guarding her in my castle, which has little to offer except for the fire and heat that escape from my nostrils.I am the dragon in this fairytale who will one day get mercilessly slayed by the prince. The prince of eternal peace. Till then I warn my damsel about the oblivion that awaits her outside this palace.
Love is tragedy in waiting. Love is death in disguise. Sometimes I open the doors allowing the flames of lust to consume the sorrow and despair that lingers in air above. Sometimes I set the land on fire horrified by the monster I have become.
Mostly you can see me guarding the doors dutifully and aimlessly making me the terrifying beast of this story, the demise of whom shall be celebrated by mothers who try to put their toddlers to sleep and knights who fight for their lady.

Till the prince rescues the princess

"To die, to sleep<br>
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub<br>
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br>
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
Must give us pause: there's the respect<br>
That makes calamity of so long life."

Through this windowpane<br>
I glance at you,dear oak<br>
for isn’t it cold out there.To be<br>
amongst the unforgiving and fierce<br>
and yet to hold on to your leaves<br>
in a storm like this.<br>
The storm whose eye and mine<br>
are alike in many ways.Calm yet<br>
unsettling while havoc rages<br>
elsewhere, I glance numbingly<br>
at you rooted below with the dirt<br>
I shall unite with one dusk.<br>
Till then I cradle my memories<br>
through nooks and corners .For,alas!<br>
one day they shall too fly away<br>
in the winds of time leaving voids<br>
my nightmares will attempt to fill.<br>
Regardless I collect everything<br>
predestined to drift away with the<br>
passage of time patching old bruises<br>
making space for wounds anew.<br>
