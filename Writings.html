<center><u>Is death colorful?</u>
<br>
<font size=1>S Manasvini</font></center>
<br>
I assume death is colourful .Maybe like autumn,the crimson red hue that
carpets the most dullest roads. Lingering and impending. At times I hope
it looks like winter. Violet and blue skies showering chaste ivory on my
windowpane. I wonder if the deep oceanic tone,make blueberries jealous,do
they weep to doom or find solace that they shall finally rest under the same
blue ?
<br>
I wish its both sombre and colourful. Deep tinted to make people engrossed
with it, dull enough to not compete with life. It should change, from scarlet
to ombre, a gentle gradient. Turbulence has tired me enough. I think about
it to be a field of crocodile and fern,much alike the garden of Eden, where it
all started.Sombre in hurricanes and sultry afternoons, whimsical with white
daffodils aiming for the clouds and amber succulents reminding of times I
stood out and rebelled.
<br>
It should have lilac undertones. Lilac like innocence ,piercing through my
eyes. Wine and plum radiating out of nowhere reminding me of dreams that
kept my nightmares away. Speckles of honey spots stab me like hope which
keeps me awake while I am floating in vivid shades of life yearning to sink in
a yard of graves.

"To die, to sleep<br>
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub<br>
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br>
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
Must give us pause: there's the respect<br>
That makes calamity of so long life."

<b>Lost in the Tempest</b><br>

<br>
<br>
Through this windowpane<br>
I glance at you,dear oak<br>
for isn’t it cold out there.To be<br>
amongst the unforgiving and fierce<br>
and yet to hold on to your leaves<br>
in a storm like this.<br>
The storm whose eye and mine<br>
are alike in many ways.Calm yet<br>
unsettling while havoc rages<br>
elsewhere, I glance numbingly<br>
at you rooted below with the dirt<br>
I shall unite with one dusk.<br>
Till then I cradle my memories<br>
through nooks and corners .For,alas!<br>
one day they shall too fly away<br>
in the winds of time leaving voids<br>
my nightmares will attempt to fill.<br>
Regardless I collect everything<br>
predestined to drift away with the<br>
passage of time patching old bruises<br>
making space for wounds anew.<br>
